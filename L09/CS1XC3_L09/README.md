#### Purpose:
>The purpose of this software is to mainpulate structs to show how they can be used in C. In this program we had used
the example of courses and students and we generate a course and generate 20 students and then call functions that can filter through them
and output them.


#### Installation Instructions:
1. You will need a GCC compiler and a linux system
2. You will have to clone this repository onto your Linux system
3. Make a directory on your system called **L09**
4. Go into that directory
5. Type in the command **git submodule add git@github.com:Luciferr5/CS1XC3_L09.git**
6. The repository should be cloned now

#### Configuration Instructions:
1. In the CS1XC3_L09 type this command **Make main**
2. To execute type in the command **./build/main**
3. The file should be executed


#### Troubleshooting:
* In the case that it does not let you execute the main file type in the command **chmod +x main** and try again
* If the Make main does not work properly try deleting the submodule and adding it again following the same steps above
* If it still does not work, restart your computer
