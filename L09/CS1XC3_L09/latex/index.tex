\subsection*{Project\+: C\+S1\+X\+C3 Lab 9}

\subsubsection*{Date\+: {\bfseries 27/3/2023}}

\paragraph*{Purpose\+:}

$>$The purpose of this software is to mainpulate structs to show how they can be used in C. In this program we had used the example of courses and students and we generate a course and generate 20 students and then call functions that can filter through them and output them.

\paragraph*{Installation Instructions\+:}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item You will need a G\+CC compiler and a linux system
\item You will have to clone this repository onto your Linux system
\item Make a directory on your system called {\bfseries L09}
\item Go into that directory
\item Type in the command $\ast$$\ast$git submodule add \href{mailto:git@github.com}{\tt git@github.\+com}\+:Luciferr5/\+C\+S1\+X\+C3\+\_\+\+L09.\+git$\ast$$\ast$
\item The repository should be cloned now
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\paragraph*{Configuration Instructions\+:}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item In the C\+S1\+X\+C3\+\_\+\+L09 type this command {\bfseries Make main}
\item To execute type in the command $\ast$$\ast$./build/main$\ast$$\ast$
\item The file should be executed
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\paragraph*{Troubleshooting\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In the case that it does not let you execute the main file type in the command {\bfseries chmod +x main} and try again
\item If the Make main does not work properly try deleting the submodule and adding it again following the same steps above
\item If it still does not work, restart your computer
\end{DoxyItemize}
