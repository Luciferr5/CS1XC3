Q2 - Describe the differences between Linux and Windows (or macOS) based on your own experience
with them so far.
Ans - When comparing macOS vs Linux, macOS feels smoother, faster, and easier. MacOS and Linux are similar because they both use open-source software however, Linux is only open source meanwhile Mac still has some closed-source parts. Linux can also be accessed through the macOS terminal where we can practice using Linux commands.
